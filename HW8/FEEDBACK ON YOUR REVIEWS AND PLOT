your reviews were ok, but a bit shallow and did not address all the points. 9/10

NOTES ON YOUR PLOT
===================


good colorblind-safe choice of color

side by side histogram helps comparison

it is not clear why the choice of overtime cut is different since the "overtime" for costumers seem to be a very large number. but it may be a necessary choice (i.e. it is possible that the data did not offer the information) in which case however it may have been better to include all >30 minutes trips in a single bin for customers as well

labels are readable (minutes could be a bit larger font)


NOTES ON THE PLOTS YOU REVIEWED
===========================================


lanimc
============

the points are green but the legend is blue.

it is not clear what the legend means: it probably means the size corresponds to the duration, but this is just an educated guess as the nothing in the legend refers to size

the color is unexplained and appears to be redundant with the size

tick labels are way too small

large values on the y axis should be substituted by a compact notation (eg using units of 1000 trips)



cindyliu
============

the colors are not explained nor is the transparency

for the large numbers on x and y axis a more concise notation should be chosen

the 3d dimension is unnecessary and possibly redundant with the color. 

the 3d dimension makes the readability of the Square footage and of the # of units hard to read away from the edges of the respective axis ranges



JiangTianqi
============
  
the repeated color pattern does not allow categories to be distinguished (seafood-chinese, steakhouse-italian...)

in this case making two separate panels for this plots would be advisable

point size is unnecessarily large and hides observations (despite the transparency)

labels are nice and readable, title is explanatory, legend is well placed
